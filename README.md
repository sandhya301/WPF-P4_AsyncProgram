Simulate an online order processing system using async programming. Your program should:
a) Ask the user for an order name.
b) Display "Processing order..."
c) Wait 3 seconds (to simulate processing time).
d) Display "Order for [item] is ready!"
Use async and await to make the processing non-blocking.
